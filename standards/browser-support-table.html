    <li>This tool's audience is roughly 1.75% on IE 7.</li>
    <li>All it took to add full IE9 support was a simple 100 KB polyfill, which we expect won't bother people on IE9 who really want to use the tool.</li>
    <li>Only need to support browsers that are allowed on CFPB devices.</li>
</ol>
another way to lay out this table would be:

list by browser
label A, B, C, D in each cell
